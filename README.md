# CRUD API Study

<br>

## What is CRUD API Study?
The "CRUD API Study" explores the basic functionality of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (i.e. CRUD) operations which
are the four basic functions of persistent storage.  This study uses a simple blog application as an example.

In an express applicaion such as this study, CRUD operations will help CREATE a blog post, READ the blog post so that the user
can see it, UPDATE the blog post, and DELETE the blog post if necessary.

## Does CRUD API Study feature commentary?
Yes! The CRUD API Study features commentary in the server.js, models.js, and blogPostsRouter.js files.

## What are the key features of the PUT Endpoints Functionality Study?
