## What is CRUD API Study?
The "CRUD API Study" explores the basic functionality of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (i.e. CRUD) operations. This study uses a simple blog application as an example to demonstrate CRUD operations which will: CREATE a blog post, READ the blog post, UPDATE the blog post with new or amended information, and DELETE the blog post by removing it from storage.
